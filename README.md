# Ai-Powered-Medical-Expenses-Sanction-System
AI–Powered Medical Expenses Sanction System
This project leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to automate the sanctioning of medical expenses. It uses a predictive model to assess claims efficiently and accurately, reducing manual intervention and ensuring a streamlined process.

# Dataset Description
The dataset used for training and testing the models includes attributes such as:

Patient Details: Age, gender, medical history, and pre-existing conditions.
Claim Information: Amount claimed, treatment type, and hospital classification.
Policy Details: Insurance type, coverage limits, and claim history.
The dataset was pre-processed to handle missing values, normalize data, and balance class distribution for optimal model performance.

# Models Implemented
Multiple machine learning algorithms were explored and implemented to predict the likelihood of claim sanction:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
Neural Networks
The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Among these, the Decision Tree model exhibited the best accuracy and interpretability.

# Instructions to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure Python is installed along with the following libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
TensorFlow/Keras (if running Neural Network models)
Navigate to the project directory and execute the respective Python scripts for data pre-processing, model training, and prediction.
The results, including performance metrics and visualizations, will be displayed after script execution.
# Results
The project demonstrated a high level of accuracy in predicting the sanctionability of medical claims. The Decision Tree model outperformed others in terms of interpretability and accuracy, making it the most suitable approach for this use case.

# Conclusion
The AI–Powered Medical Expenses Sanction System is a significant step towards automating medical expense sanctioning using AI. By utilizing machine learning, it ensures efficiency, fairness, and faster claim processing.

# Troubleshooting
For any issues encountered during execution or further clarification, please contact the project owner or raise an issue in the GitHub repository.
